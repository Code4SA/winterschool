            <h2>What's this about?</h2>
            <p>The Winter School aims to train working journalists in the fundamentals of data-driven storytelling. We will also offer training in social media as a journalism tool, with a focus on the discovery and verification of content. Participants will be introduced to all aspects of data and social media journalism, with structured course material. 
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>This will be coupled with hands-on practical work to ensure that you are able to translate what you’ve learned into great stories. After completion, participants will “hit the ground running” to be able to incorporate their new skills in their day-to-day work as journalists. Another outcome of the course is that participants will produce their own data-driven multimedia story that can be taken back to their workplace or, in the case of freelancers, offer it for sale and add to their own portfolios.

            <h4>It’s data JOURNALISM, not DATA journalism</h4>

            <p>
            You don’t need to be a coder or have technical skills to practice data journalism. 
            What you do need are basic Excel skills and a nose for a good story to help you explore the data and find the hidden stories.
