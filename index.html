            <h2 align="center">Data and Social Media Journalism Cadet School</h2>
            <p>Sadly, the media managers and bean counters in South Africa often don’t see the value of data and social media journalism, especially how it could be monetised. As a result they are generally not prepared to invest in growing these skills and resources in newsrooms.</p>
            <p>In addition, as few journalism schools offer either of these forms of journalism in their curricula, there is a dearth of these skills in South Africa. The result is that these skills are often scarce and, as a result, prohibitively expensive.</p>
            <p>The <a href="#winter-school">Winter School</a> aims to fill this gap, teaching working journalists the fundamentals of data and data-driven journalism, as well as social media as a journalism tool, with a focus on discovery and verification of content. Participants will be introduced to all aspects of data and social media journalism, with structured course material. This will be coupled with hands-on practical work to ensure the learnings are fully internalised.
The aim is for participants to “hit the ground running” and be able to be able to incorporate their new skills in their day-to-day works as journalists.
