        <h2>What's this about?</h2>
        <p>The Winter School aims to bridge that gap by training working journalists in the fundamentals of data journalism. We will also offer training in social media as a journalism tool, with a focus on discovery and verification of content. <br>
Participants will be introduced to all aspects of data and social media journalism, with structured course material. This will be coupled with hands-on practical work to ensure that you are able to translate what you’ve learned into great storytelling. <br>
The aim is for participants to “hit the ground running” and be able to be able to incorporate their new skills in their day-to-day works as journalists.<br>
To lay to rest one misconception: you don’t need to be a coder or have technical skills to practice data journalism.<br>
What you need is a nose for a good story to help you explore the data and find the stories hidden in the data.<br>
Bottom line: it’s called data JOURNALISM, not DATA journalism. </p>
